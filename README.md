Problem Statement:
Create a machine learning model which will help the company in determining the salary of newly
hired employees using the given data
Task:
As a data analyst at TechWorks Consulting, you are given the task of creating a machine
learning model which will help them in determining the salary of newly hired employees using
the given data.
You have to define your approach and then perform all the tasks required step by step to make
the prediction, and then ultimately perform predictive analysis to predict the salary.
In data preparation you have to change the college field into numerical data type with the help of
the tier of that college, similar thing you have to do with the city field and you also have to create
dummy variables for “Role”.
Try to find out the outliers and missing values and clean the data further and after the data is
ready create a predictive model to predict the salary.
You can choose any regression model but in the end you have to state your reason for choosing
that model. You can try multiple models and then pick one with the best accuracy and also state
the reason why this model performed better then the others and in what ways you can further
improve the accuracy of the selected model.
